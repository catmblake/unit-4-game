# unit-4-game
This application is a crystal collector game. At the start of each game there are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page, each with a random value between 1 and 12 that remains hidden from the user. The player is shown a random number between 19 and 120 at the start of the game which the player must match. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add that crystal's value to their score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts automatically after each win/loss.
