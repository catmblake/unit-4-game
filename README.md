# Crystal Collector
### Overview
This application is a crystal collector game. In order to win the player must collect crystals that amount to the same value as a target score that is displayed to them at the beginning of the game.
### How It Works
At the start of each game there are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page, each with a randomly generated value between 1 and 12 that remains hidden from the user. The player is shown a randomly generated number between 19 and 120 at the start of the game which they must match. Each time the player clicks on a crystal, it will add that crystal's value to their score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts automatically after each win/loss.
